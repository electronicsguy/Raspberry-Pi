#Module Config

This script helps in enabling/disabling modules or boot-time settings on the Raspberry Pi.
It reads data from the file: /boot/config.txt
It displays a list of current settings or modules installed.
It only comments/uncomments out lines in the config file.
No kernel modifications are done.
